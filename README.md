# DataManager

At Paralov, we're trying to build solutions that allow you to ship faster in Roblox. Data sits at the core of most games, and this is our attempt at making an easy to use type-friendly interface for it.

> This is a work in progress and is not ready for general use.


## Compatibility
Look at our solution as an abstraction layer over your existing or future DataStore implementation. Our goal is not to replace solutions like [Lapis](https://github.com/nezuo/lapis), [ProfileStore](https://github.com/MadStudioRoblox/ProfileStore) or it's predecessor ProfileService. Instead, we rely on them to handle the actual process of interfacing with Roblox DataStores.
